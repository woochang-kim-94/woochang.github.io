    <h2>What I am reading</h2> 

    Motivated by my friends, I started archiving my self-study during my grad life. I listed textbooks and literatures I have been reading in chronological order. It doesn't necessarily mean that I have read the whole contents of the lists, though I'm hoping that this list also motivates me to do that...<br><br>

    <h3> Spring 2023 </h3>
    Many-Body Qunatum Theory in Condensed Matter Physics (Bruus, Flensberg) <br>
    A Guide to Feynman Diagrams in the Many-Body Problem (Mattuck) <br>
    M. S. Hybertsen and S. G. Louie, Phys Rev B 34, 5390 (1986). <br>
